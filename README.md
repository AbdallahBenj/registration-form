# Learn HTML Forms by Building a Registration Form

## Overview
In this project, I built a **registration/signup form** to demonstrate the use of **HTML forms** for collecting information from users. The form allows users to input their data, and Iâ€™ve used various HTML attributes to control the data types and ensure validation.
